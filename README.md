# Container-Startup-Latency-Memory-Overhead-Microbenchmark-Suite
A lightweight microbenchmark suite for measuring container runtime overhead. Captures startup latency, RSS memory usage, and CPU utilization for different container runtimes (Docker, containerd, gVisor, Firecracker). Includes a simple C workload, host-side measurement scripts, and CSV/plot generation for analysis.
